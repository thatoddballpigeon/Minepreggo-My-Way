# Configuration Timers Guide (AI-generated content)

This guide explains all the configurable timer settings in the Minepreggo mod. These settings control how long various pregnancy-related effects last and can be customized in the mod's configuration file. It can use the "configured" mod to modify the .toml files, but it has to close and reopen the game for the changes to take effect.

## Understanding Ticks

All timers in this guide are measured in **Minecraft ticks**. One Minecraft day (day-night cycle) equals 24,000 ticks.

**Quick Reference:**
- 20 ticks = 1 second
- 1,200 ticks = 1 minute
- 24,000 ticks = 1 Minecraft day (20 minutes real-time)

## Core Pregnancy Timers

### Total Pregnancy Days
**Configuration Name:** `totalPregnancyDays`

**Default Value:** 50 days

**Range:** 20 to 2,147,483,647 days

**Description:**
This setting controls how many days a pregnancy lasts from conception to birth. This is the primary timer that determines pregnancy length.

**Calculation:**
- Total pregnancy duration = `totalPregnancyDays` × `totalTickByPregnancyDays` ticks
- With defaults (50 days × 24,000 ticks/day) = 1,200,000 ticks = 50 Minecraft days = ~16.7 real-world hours

**Impact:**
- Lower values = shorter pregnancies (faster progression through phases)
- Higher values = longer pregnancies (more time in each phase, more challenges)

**Recommended Adjustments:**
- Shorter gameplay: 20-30 days
- Standard gameplay: 40-60 days
- Extended roleplay: 70-100+ days

---

### Total Ticks Per Pregnancy Day
**Configuration Name:** `totalTickByPregnancyDays`

**Default Value:** 24,000 ticks

**Range:** 100 to 24,000 ticks

**Description:**
Controls how many in-game ticks constitute one "pregnancy day." At 24,000 ticks, one pregnancy day equals one Minecraft day (approximately 20 real-world minutes).

**Calculation:**
- One pregnancy day = `totalTickByPregnancyDays` ticks of in-game time

**Impact:**
- At 24,000: 1 pregnancy day = 1 Minecraft day
- At 12,000: 1 pregnancy day = 0.5 Minecraft days (pregnancy progresses 2x faster)
- At 6,000: 1 pregnancy day = 0.25 Minecraft days (pregnancy progresses 4x faster)

**Recommended Adjustments:**
- Faster progression: 12,000-18,000 ticks
- Standard progression: 24,000 ticks
- Slower progression: Not recommended (values below 24,000 accelerate time)

**Note:** This timer works in conjunction with `totalPregnancyDays`. Decreasing this value makes pregnancies progress faster in real-time.

---

### Ticks To Start Pregnancy
**Configuration Name:** `ticksToStartPregnancy`

**Default Value:** 4,800 ticks

**Range:** 100 to 24,000 ticks

**Conversion:** 
- Default (4,800 ticks) = 4 real-world minutes of in-game time

**Description:**
The delay between mating (impregnation) and when pregnancy actually begins. This represents a "conception period" where the pregnancy is established but not yet detected.

**Impact:**
- Lower values = immediate pregnancy detection
- Higher values = longer delay before pregnancy shows (pregnancy counter starts later)

**Recommended Adjustments:**
- Immediate: 100-500 ticks
- Short delay: 2,400-4,800 ticks (2-4 real-world minutes)
- Long delay: 6,000-12,000 ticks (5-10 real-world minutes)

**Gameplay Implications:**
- Shorter delays = pregnancies start faster after mating
- Longer delays = more time passes before pregnancy becomes apparent

---

### Maternity Lactation Duration
**Configuration Name:** `totalTicksOfMaternityLactation`

**Default Value:** 1,200 ticks

**Range:** 100 to 2,147,483,647 ticks

**Conversion:**
- Default (1,200 ticks) = 1 real-world minute of in-game time

**Description:**
The duration of the lactation/breast milk phase after pregnancy ends and babies are born. During this period, the pregnant entity (player or mob) can produce milk.

**Impact:**
- Lower values = shorter lactation period
- Higher values = longer lactation period (can produce milk longer)

**Recommended Adjustments:**
- Short lactation: 600-1,200 ticks
- Medium lactation: 2,400-6,000 ticks (2-5 real-world minutes)
- Extended lactation: 12,000+ ticks (10+ real-world minutes)

**Gameplay Implications:**
- Shorter periods = less time to farm milk
- Longer periods = more time to collect multiple bottles of milk

---

### Post Pregnancy Phase Duration
**Configuration Name:** `totalTicksOfPostPregnancyPhase`

**Default Value:** 24,000 ticks

**Range:** 100 to 2,147,483,647 ticks

**Conversion:**
- Default (24,000 ticks) = 1 Minecraft day (20 real-world minutes)

**Description:**
The recovery period after lactation ends. During this phase, the entity recovers from pregnancy before becoming able to become pregnant again.

**Impact:**
- Lower values = faster recovery (can become pregnant again sooner)
- Higher values = longer recovery (must wait longer for next pregnancy)

**Recommended Adjustments:**
- Short recovery: 6,000-12,000 ticks (5-10 real-world minutes)
- Standard recovery: 24,000 ticks (1 Minecraft day)
- Extended recovery: 48,000+ ticks (40+ real-world minutes)

**Gameplay Implications:**
- Shorter periods = continuous rapid pregnancies
- Longer periods = enforces spacing between pregnancies

## Pregnancy Symptom Timers

These timers control how often various pregnancy symptoms activate during different pregnancy phases. The system calculates values for each phase based on a base value, decreasing as pregnancy progresses.

### Hunger Timer (Base Value)
**Configuration Name:** `totalTicksOfHungry`

**Default Value:** 4,800 ticks

**Range:** 100 to 24,000 ticks

**Conversion:**
- Default (4,800 ticks) = 4 real-world minutes of in-game time

**Description:**
The base timer for how often the "Hungry" effect activates during Phase 0 (P0). This effect causes increased hunger during early pregnancy.

**Phase Calculations:**
The mod automatically calculates hunger timers for each phase as percentages of P0:
- P0: 100% (4,800 ticks) - baseline
- P1: 85% (4,080 ticks) - more frequent hunger
- P2: 80% (3,840 ticks)
- P3: 75% (3,600 ticks)
- P4: 70% (3,360 ticks)
- P5: 65% (3,120 ticks)
- P6: 60% (2,880 ticks)
- P7: 55% (2,640 ticks)
- P8: 50% (2,400 ticks) - most frequent hunger

**Impact:**
- Lower base value = more frequent hunger (pregnant entities need food more often)
- Higher base value = less frequent hunger

**Recommended Adjustments:**
- Harsh hunger: 2,400-3,600 ticks
- Standard hunger: 4,800 ticks
- Reduced hunger: 6,000-8,000 ticks

---

### Craving Timer (Base Value)
**Configuration Name:** `totalTicksOfCraving`

**Default Value:** 4,800 ticks

**Range:** 100 to 24,000 ticks

**Conversion:**
- Default (4,800 ticks) = 4 real-world minutes of in-game time

**Description:**
The base timer for how often cravings activate during Phase 1 (P1). This controls the frequency of food cravings during pregnancy.

**Phase Calculations:**
The mod automatically calculates craving timers for each phase as percentages of P1:
- P1: 100% (4,800 ticks) - baseline
- P2: 80% (3,840 ticks)
- P3: 75% (3,600 ticks)
- P4: 70% (3,360 ticks)
- P5: 65% (3,120 ticks)
- P6: 60% (2,880 ticks)
- P7: 55% (2,640 ticks)
- P8: 50% (2,400 ticks) - most frequent cravings

**Impact:**
- Lower base value = more frequent cravings (need to satisfy cravings more often)
- Higher base value = less frequent cravings

**Recommended Adjustments:**
- Frequent cravings: 2,400-3,600 ticks (challenging gameplay)
- Standard cravings: 4,800 ticks
- Rare cravings: 6,000-12,000 ticks (relaxed gameplay)

**Gameplay Implications:**
- Shorter intervals = more engagement with craving system
- Longer intervals = less constant management needed

### Milking Timer (Base Value)
**Configuration Name:** `totalTicksOfMilking`

**Default Value:** 4,800 ticks

**Range:** 100 to 24,000 ticks

**Conversion:**
- Default (4,800 ticks) = 4 real-world minutes of in-game time

**Description:**
The base timer for how often the "Milking" effect activates during Phase 2 (P2). This controls the frequency of milk production during lactation.

**Phase Calculations:**
The mod automatically calculates milking timers for each phase as percentages of P2:
- P2: 100% (4,800 ticks) - baseline
- P3: 75% (3,600 ticks)
- P4: 70% (3,360 ticks)
- P5: 65% (3,120 ticks)
- P6: 60% (2,880 ticks)
- P7: 55% (2,640 ticks)
- P8: 50% (2,400 ticks) - most frequent milking

**Impact:**
- Lower base value = more frequent milking (produce more milk)
- Higher base value = less frequent milking

**Recommended Adjustments:**
- High milk production: 2,400-3,600 ticks
- Standard production: 4,800 ticks
- Low production: 6,000-12,000 ticks

### Belly Rubs Timer (Base Value)
**Configuration Name:** `totalTicksOfBellyRubs`

**Default Value:** 4,800 ticks

**Range:** 100 to 24,000 ticks

**Conversion:**
- Default (4,800 ticks) = 4 real-world minutes of in-game time

**Description:**
The base timer for how often the "Belly Rubs" effect activates during Phase 3 (P3). This controls the frequency of needing/receiving belly rubs during pregnancy.

**Phase Calculations:**
The mod automatically calculates belly rubs timers for each phase as percentages of P3:
- P3: 100% (4,800 ticks) - baseline
- P4: 70% (3,360 ticks)

**Configuration Name:** `totalTicksOfHorny`

**Default Value:** 6,000 ticks

**Range:** 100 to 24,000 ticks

**Conversion:**
- Default (6,000 ticks) = 5 real-world minutes of in-game time

**Description:**
The base timer for how often the "Horny" effect activates during Phase 4 (P4). This controls the frequency of sexual attraction during later pregnancy phases.

**Phase Calculations:**
The mod automatically calculates horniness timers for each phase as percentages of P4:

## How to Edit Configuration

### Finding the Configuration File

The configuration file is typically located at:
```
.minecraft/config/minepreggo-common.toml
```

Or in a modpack:
```
/config/minepreggo-common.toml
```

### Editing Values

Open the configuration file in a text editor and find the "Common" section:

```toml
[Common]
    # Total number of pregnancy days.
    # Range: 20 ~ 2147483647
    totalPregnancyDays = 50
    
    # Total ticks per pregnancy day.
    # Range: 100 ~ 24000
    totalTickByDays = 24000
    
    # Ticks to start pregnancy after mating.
    # Range: 100 ~ 24000
    ticksToStartPregnancy = 4800
    
    # Total ticks of craving for pregnant entities.
    # Range: 100 ~ 24000
    totalTicksOfCraving = 4800
    
    # [Additional values...]
```

### Applying Changes

1. Edit the values as desired
2. Save the file
3. Restart Minecraft for changes to take effect (or reload config if supported)

## Tips for Configuration

1. **Start with Defaults:** Begin with default settings and adjust based on your experience
2. **Make Small Changes:** Change one value at a time to understand its effect
3. **Document Changes:** Keep track of what you modify for troubleshooting
4. **Balance Challenges:** Don't make all symptoms too frequent or rare
5. **Consider Playtime:** Align pregnancy length with how much you play
6. **Test in Creative:** Try changes in creative mode first
7. **Reload Config:** Some servers support `/reload` commands without restarting

## Common Configuration Questions

**Q: Can I have very long pregnancies?**
A: Yes! Set `totalPregnancyDays` to 100+ and reduce `totalTickByPregnancyDays` if needed.

**Q: How do I make pregnancy pass quickly?**
A: Lower `totalPregnancyDays` (20-30) and reduce symptom timers to 3,000-4,000 ticks.

**Q: Why are symptoms more frequent in later phases?**
A: The system automatically increases frequency as pregnancy progresses. This is by design.

**Q: Can I disable symptoms?**
A: Set symptom timers to very high values (20,000+) to make them extremely rare.

**Q: What happens if I set invalid values?**
A: The mod will use the nearest valid value or fall back to defaults.

# PreggoMobs System - (AI-generated content)

## Overview

The PreggoMobs system adds special female creatures to the Minepreggo mod that can become pregnant and have unique interactions. The main creatures are **Zombie Girls** and **Humanoid Creeper Girls**. These mobs have two distinct modes of operation: their normal non-pregnant state and their multi-stage pregnancy system.

## Part 1: Base PreggoMob System (Non-Pregnant)

### General Characteristics

PreggoMobs are intelligent, tamable creatures that have complex AI and interaction systems:

- **Ownership:** Can be tamed by players (similar to wolves)
- **Inventory:** Have their own inventory system for storing items
- **Intelligence:** React to their environment and owner's actions
- **Interaction:** Can be right-clicked for various interactions based on situation

### Fullness & Hunger System

**Fullness Meter:**
- PreggoMobs have a fullness value (0-100)
- They need food to maintain fullness
- Fullness decreases over time

**Hunger Levels:**
- When fullness is low (≤ 4), the mob becomes **Angry**
- Angry mobs will:
  - Search for the nearest player every 5 seconds (100 ticks)
  - Target their owner if not in Creative/Spectator mode
  - Attack if hungry enough
  - Stop being angry when fed (fullness > 4)

**Feeding:**
- Players can feed PreggoMobs by giving them food
- Fullness increases when food is consumed
- Well-fed mobs are friendly and cooperative

### Owned vs. Wild Mobs

**Owned Mobs (Tamed):**
- Have a specific owner (player)
- Won't attack their owner
- Can be right-clicked for interactions
- More docile and cooperative
- Can carry items in inventory
- Respond to owner's actions

**Wild/Monster Mobs (Untamed):**
- Spawn naturally in the world
- Will attack players
- Can be tamed by the right interactions
- Convert to owned version upon successful taming

### Mob Variants

**Zombie Girls:**
- Appear as zombie humanoids
- Can transform between monster (untamed) and tamable (owned) forms
- Spawn naturally in dark areas
- Convert to tamable form when impregnated

**Humanoid Creeper Girls:**
- Appear as creeper-shaped humanoids
- Similar taming and transformation mechanics as Zombie Girls
- More rare spawning
- Convert to tamable form when impregnated

**Ender Girls:**
- Ender-based humanoid creatures
- Same mechanics as other PreggoMobs

## Part 2: Pregnancy System

When a PreggoMob becomes pregnant, it enters a detailed pregnancy progression system with 9 stages (P0 through P8).

### How Pregnancy Begins

**Three Ways to Become Pregnant:**

1. **Impregnation Potion**
   - Owner gives the mob an impregnation potion
   - Potion effect expires → pregnancy triggered
   - Mob converts to tamable form (if wild)
   - Immediately enters P0 pregnancy stage

2. **Natural Sex with Male Player**
   - Male player and female mob interact
   - Only if both are interested (sexual appetite/horny enough)
   - Can produce human babies or babies of the mother's species
   - Mob stays in her current species form

### Pregnancy Progression System

The pregnancy duration is **always the same** (configured number of days), regardless of how many babies the mother is carrying. What changes based on baby count is the **number of pregnancy stages the mother must go through** before giving birth.

**How It Works:**

The total pregnancy days are divided equally among the stages needed. More babies = more stages needed = shorter duration per stage.

**Examples:**

If total pregnancy is 40 days:

- **1 baby:** Ends at **P4** (4 stages: P1, P2, P3, P4) = ~10 days per stage
- **2 babies:** Ends at **P5** (5 stages: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5) = ~8 days per stage
- **3 babies:** Ends at **P6** (6 stages) = ~6.7 days per stage
- **4 babies:** Ends at **P7** (7 stages) = ~5.7 days per stage
- **5+ babies:** Ends at **P8** (8 stages: P1-P8) = ~5 days per stage

**Key Point:** A mother carrying 5 babies doesn't have a longer pregnancy than a mother with 1 baby—they both take 40 days. The difference is that the mother with 5 babies progresses through more pregnancy stages in the same timeframe, making each stage shorter and more compressed.

### Pregnancy Stages (P0 to P8)

#### **Stage P0: Early Pregnancy (Minimal Effects)**

**Duration:** Configurable (e.g., 5-10 days)

**What Happens:**
- Pregnancy is initialized
- No visible symptoms yet
- Mob can still perform normal activities
- No cravings or lactation
- Owner is notified pregnancy began
- Mob's body shows no changes

**Interactions:**
- Owner can still feed the mob
- Right-click only triggers belly rubs (always fails - belly too small)
- Mob continues normal behavior

**End Condition:**
- Days passed = configured days per stage
- Automatically advances to P1

---

#### **Stage P1: Early Pregnancy (Cravings Begin)**

**Duration:** Configurable days

**What Happens:**
- Craving system activates
- Morning sickness begins (random)
- Mob becomes uncomfortable
- Belly starts showing slight changes

**New Mechanics:**

1. **Cravings:**
   - Specific food items crave over time
   - Owner can feed special craving items to satisfy
   - Satisfied cravinggs reduce discomfort
   - If cravings not satisfied, mob gets angry

2. **Morning Sickness:**
   - Random nausea effects
   - Probability: Low (20% chance each tick when evaluating)
   - Lasts for 6 seconds when triggered
   - Cause discomfort

**Interactions:**
- Right-click with appropriate food → satisfy craving (SUCCESS)
- Right-click with wrong food → mob gets angry (ANGRY)
- Belly rubs still fail (belly not large enough)

**Mood:**
- More irritable than P0
- Gets angry if hungry
- Gets angry if cravings not satisfied

---

#### **Stage P2: Milk Production Begins**

**Duration:** Configurable days

**What Happens:**
- Lactation system activates
- Milk production begins
- Milking symptom develops

- Belly becomes more noticeable

**New Mechanics:**

1. **Milking:**
   - Milk builds up over time (every ~30-60 seconds depending on config)
   - Reaches maximum level when "too full"
   - Owner can milk the mob with a glass bottle
   - Creates milk item (species-specific: Zombie milk, Creeper milk, etc.)
   - Reduces milk level when milked

2. **Lactation Symptom:**
   - When milk reaches activation threshold (50+ out of 100)
   - Mob shows discomfort from full milk
   - Cannot wear certain chest armor while lactating

**Interactions:**
- Right-click with glass bottle → collect milk (SUCCESS)
- Can satisfy cravings with appropriate food
- Belly rubs still fail

**Mood:**
- Gets angry if milking level is too high (≥ 80)
- Still gets angry if hungry or cravings unsatisfied
- More irritable overall

   - Lasts ~8 seconds when triggered
   - Visible/audible effects

2. **Belly Rubs:**
   - Owner can right-click to rub belly
   - Provides comfort and reduces irritability
   - Builds belly rubs meter
   - Belly rubs decrease stress

3. **Audio Effects:**
   - Stomach growling sounds
   - Different sounds based on pregnancy pain

**Interactions:**
- Right-click with glass bottle → collect milk
- Right-click with food → satisfy cravings
- Right-click empty → rub belly and reduce stress (if belly rubs available)

**Armor Restrictions:**

   - When reaches peak (100), HORNY symptom activates
   - Mob wants to breed/have sex
   - Increases risk of requesting sex from owner

2. **Contractions:**
   - Random contractions as labor approaches
   - Higher probability than fetal movements
   - Stronger pain effects
   - Lasts ~12 seconds
